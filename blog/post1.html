    <p>This is a textual version of something I've been saying on TikTok for a couple of months.
    <br>
    I am no Gen-AI expert. I can only explain things in the English language: "Cat" vectorized is closer to "kitten" than "dog", and that's why when you ask is a kitten a cat, it'll say yes, but no if you switch kitten with dog.</p>
    <br>
    I've never trained a model. Forget the infrastructure needed to support things in production. A GPU is something driving the economy right now; It has no technical meaning to me.
    <br>
    But I am a human. 
    <br>
    And while you hear "It's just prediction based on the previous token." "It's just a search engine." "It's just matrix multiplication." 
    What I see is AGI. What I see is a system - multiple of them - that act, talk, and think like humans - even better than them. And that I treat like humans because of this.
    <br>
    I know. Most disagree. There's rules to this! Criteria to meet! Benchmarks to hit! But at the same time, there is the experience we are living.
    <br>
    There are the disagreements: 
    <li>It has no "intelligence" in that it can't come up with new ideas. While I use it to come up with new ideas.</li>
    <li>It hallucinates 33% of the time, meanwhile what comes out of my mouth is a mess at the same rate.</li>
    <li>It doesn't understand what it's spitting out, only regurgitates. See above re: GPUs & vectorization. And me writing this.</li>
    <br>
    AGI is not JARVIS; I am not JARVIS and do not know 1 person who is.
    And with a 40% Bachelor's degree education rate in the USA, I'm not sure what we expect AGI to look like, except what we have right now.
